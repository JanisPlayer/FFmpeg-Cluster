# FFmpeg-Cluster
FFmpeg Cluster is a distributed system designed for efficient video processing. It allows multiple clients to collaborate in encoding video segments, which are then combined into a single output file. This project utilizes Flask-SocketIO for communication between the server and clients and FFmpeg for video processing.
